Reflection

1. How does Kanban help manage workload and priorities?
    Kanban visually organizes tasks into clear, manageable steps, making it easier to see the status and priority of each task. By setting limits on Work in Progress (WIP), it prevents overload, ensures a balanced workflow, and helps identify bottlenecks early, allowing for quicker adjustments and improved productivity.

2. How can you apply Agile principles to improve your role and responsibilities?
    I can consistently provide transparent updates about my progress, actively seek feedback, and promptly adjust based on new information. Practicing regular reviews of tasks in the Kanban board also helps prioritize effectively, reducing bottlenecks and promoting efficient work completion.
