1. What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?
  -Focus Bear distinguishes out in the productivity app landscape because it takes a holistic approach to productivity and habit development.  Unlike programs like Freedom or Cold Turkey, which solely focus on distraction blocking, Focus Bear includes several features:
   i. Routine Guidance: It helps users build and stick to morning and evening routines with step-by-step guidance and timers, promoting healthy habits alongside productivity.
   ii. Cross Device Blocking: Focus Bear blocks distractions across both desktop and mobile devices simultaneously, ensuring a seamless focus environment.
   iii. Break Management: It provides pre-chosen, productive break activities (e.g., stretching or breathing exercises) with countdown timers to encourage rejuvenation without overextending breaks.
   iv. Customization: The app allows users to create tailored focus modes and block lists, adapting to individual needs for deep work.

2. If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?
   - It combines habit-building with productivity tools, offering more than just task or focus management.
   - Its AuDHD-friendly design caters to users with executive dysfunction by providing structured routines and visual progress tracking.
   - The Grizzly Bear mode ensures strict distraction blocking for those who need stronger accountability measures.
   - Its intelligent break reminders avoid interruptions during meetings, a feature not commonly found in other apps9.

3. What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?
   - Tiimo provides a visually appealing, color-coded timeline with icons that help users plan their day at a glance. This is especially beneficial for neurodivergent users who prefer visual aids.
   - Cold Turkey’s "Frozen Turkey" feature locks users out of their entire device for a specified period, offering an extreme but effective way to curb distractions.
  
4. Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?
   - To enhance its appeal, Focus Bear could incorporate visual planning tools, such as a timeline or calendar view for routines and tasks. This would make it easier for users to visualize their schedules and progress, aligning with features offered by apps like Tiimo. This addition would particularly benefit neurodivergent users who rely on visual aids for organization.
