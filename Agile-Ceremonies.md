1. How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?
    Agile ceremonies provide structured opportunities for the team to sync up, ensuring everyone is aligned on priorities, progress, and potential blockers. Daily stand-ups keep the team updated on each other’s work, while retrospectives help identify what’s working and what needs improvement. Backlog refinement ensures tasks are well-defined and prioritized, reducing ambiguity and inefficiencies. These ceremonies foster transparency, collaboration, and continuous improvement.

2. Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?
    For my role, backlog refinement is the most important. Since AI-related tasks often involve iterative experimentation and research, clearly defining and refining tasks ensures that requirements, expectations, and dependencies are well understood. This helps prioritize work efficiently and avoid delays caused by unclear objectives or shifting priorities.
