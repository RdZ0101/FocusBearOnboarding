 Research & Learn
1. What AI tools are typically used for your role?
  - ChatGPT (GPT-4/GPT-3.5) – For coding assistance, research, debugging, and generating ideas.
  - GitHub Copilot – For code autocompletion, suggestions, and improving coding efficiency.
  - Google Bard / Bing Chat – For quick research, troubleshooting, and summarizing information.

2. What are the benefits and risks of using AI in a professional setting?
  - Benefits: Faster coding, efficient problem-solving, rapid research.
  - Risks: Over-reliance, inaccuracies in AI outputs, accidental plagiarism, or leaking confidential info.

3. What types of information should never be entered into AI tools?
  - Confidential or proprietary data
  - Personal or sensitive information
  - Credentials (passwords, API keys)
  - Intellectual Property or unpublished code

4. How can you fact-check and validate AI-generated content to ensure accuracy?
  - Cross-reference AI output with official documentation.
  - Run and test code snippets before implementation.
  - Compare outputs from multiple AI sources.
  - Verify critical information from trusted platforms like official docs or peer-reviewed sources.


 Reflection

1. When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?
  - Use AI: Quick research, initial code ideas, debugging help, optimization suggestions.
  - Use my own skills: Critical decision-making, final implementation, sensitive tasks, validating outputs.

2. How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?
  - Start with my own analysis first before consulting AI.
  - Use AI mainly for assistance, not as the primary solution.
  - Always verify AI-generated code or information through testing and credible sources.
  - Regularly practice and enhance my coding and research skills independently.
  - Treat AI outputs as suggestions—evaluate critically before using them.
  - Reflect on the limitations of AI to maintain realistic expectations about its accuracy.

3. What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?
  - Never enter sensitive information like passwords, credentials, PII, or company secrets into AI tools.
  - Anonymize or generalize data before using it in AI prompts.
  - Check confidentiality policies before using external AI tools.
  - Use local or approved AI tools where possible, reducing external data exposure.
  - Regularly review generated content to confirm no sensitive information has accidentally been disclosed.


Task

1. Identify one task you can improve using an AI tool, and try it out.
  - I used GitHub Copilot to understand complex Python functions in our filtering system by generating inline explanations and code summaries.

2. Review the AI-generated output critically—did it require editing or fact-checking?
  - The explanations provided by AI were generally clear and insightful but required manual verification, especially for nuanced logic and context-specific use cases.

3. Document one best practice you will follow when using AI tools at Focus Bear.
  - Always verify AI-generated code explanations against original documentation and logic, ensuring accurate understanding before making any code changes.
