Reflection

1. What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup?

    I can add a laptop stand to elevate the screen to eye level, preventing neck and shoulder strain.
    I will use an external keyboard and mouse to maintain a neutral wrist position.
    Adjust my chair height and backrest to ensure feet are flat on the ground and back supported comfortably.

2. What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain?

    Taking regular short breaks every 30-60 minutes to stretch and move.
    Practicing consistent posture checks to maintain an upright and neutral spine alignment.
    Implementing the 20-20-20 rule to reduce eye strain (every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds).

3. How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day?

    Setting up regular movement and posture-check reminders using the Focus Bear app.
    Using visual cues or notes at my workstation reminding me to sit up straight and relax my shoulders.

Task

1. Workspace adjustment made:
    I elevated my laptop using a laptop stand and connected an external keyboard and mouse to create a more ergonomic workspace.

2. Identified equipment:
    A dedicated ergonomic chair would further improve my posture and comfort by providing better lumbar support.

3. Habit adjustment:
    I activated regular movement and posture reminders through Focus Bear for a full workday and noticed reduced tension in my neck and shoulders and improved overall comfort and focus.
