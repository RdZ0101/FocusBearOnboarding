1. What security measures are you currently implementing, and where can you improve?

     Current Security Measures:
         - I use strong, unique passwords for each account and use a password manager to keep track of them.
         - Most of my key accounts, particularly those related to my work, have two-factor authentication (2FA activated.
         - I update my software and systems on a regular basis to address security issues.
         - Files are backed up to safe cloud services with encryption.
         - I avoid clicking on questionable links and emails by checking the sender's identification.
   
     Opportunities for Development:
         - expanding the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) beyond the most important accounts.
         - To keep abreast of phishing techniques and other dangers, security awareness training should be conducted more frequently.
         - using a VPN more frequently, particularly when gaining remote access to private data.
         - investigating cutting-edge threat prevention solutions to improve endpoint security.

2. How can secure conduct become ingrained in your life instead of being an afterthought?

     Automate Security Procedures:
       - To reduce vulnerabilities, configure software and operating system updates to run automatically.
       - Creating and storing secure passwords automatically with a password manager.

     Frequent Training & Awareness:
       - To remain aware of emerging risks, participate in regular cybersecurity awareness training.
       - Setting reminders for chores like checking activity logs and account permissions helps keep security at the forefront of your mind.

     Regular Security Checks:
       - Developing the practice of locking displays while not in use and logging out of devices after use.
       - To lessen attack vectors, schedule monthly checks for unused accounts or programs and delete them.

     Conscious Internet Conduct:
       - Avoiding oversharing facts about one's job and exercising caution while posting information on social media.
       - Making it a practice to double-check URLs and email addresses before clicking on links.
