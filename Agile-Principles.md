Reflection

1. What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?

    Benefits:
        Increased flexibility and adaptability to changing requirements.
        Improved collaboration, communication, and teamwork.
        Enhanced productivity due to shorter feedback loops and iterative development.
        Greater transparency in work progress and priorities.

    Challenges:
        Requires consistent communication, which can be challenging in distributed teams.
        Managing changing priorities can sometimes lead to scope creep.
        Relies heavily on active engagement from all team members.

2. How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?

    Agile encourages frequent feedback and continuous improvement, enabling me to quickly adapt based on insights from team members.
    It promotes clear communication and transparency, ensuring alignment across teams.
    By breaking work into smaller, manageable tasks, Agile helps me stay focused and organized, improving productivity and reducing overwhelm.


Task

1. Summary of differences in Scrum vs. Kanban:

    Scrum:
        Fixed-length iterations called "sprints."
        Clearly defined roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team.
        Work is planned, prioritized, and committed to at the beginning of each sprint.
        Emphasis on predictability, regular sprint reviews, and retrospectives.

    Kanban:
        Continuous workflow without fixed iterations.
        Work is visualized on a Kanban board with defined stages.
        Emphasis on limiting work-in-progress (WIP) and continuous improvement.
        More flexibility to change priorities frequently.

Focus Bear prefers Kanban due to its flexibility and suitability for a rapidly changing environment, allowing continuous adaptation to user feedback and team workflows.


2. One Agile Principle Most Useful to My Work:
  "Responding to change over following a plan"
    This principle will allow me to remain flexible, adapt quickly to evolving requirements, and improve overall responsiveness in my tasks at Focus Bear.
