2. How should you store, share, and dispose of sensitive information safely?

    Store:
        Use secure, encrypted storage solutions approved by Focus Bear (such as secure cloud storage with restricted access permissions).
        Never store sensitive data on unsecured personal devices or unauthorized services.

    Share:
        Share sensitive data strictly on a need-to-know basis.
        Utilize secure methods (such as encrypted communication channels, secure links with access control, or company-approved platforms) when sharing data.

    Dispose:
        Securely delete files and data when no longer needed, following Focus Bear’s data disposal guidelines.
        Regularly clear or securely wipe temporary copies of sensitive data from local devices.


3. What are some common mistakes that lead to data privacy issues, and how can they be avoided?

   Weak passwords or shared passwords: Avoided by using unique, strong passwords and enabling MFA.
   Accidental exposure or unauthorized sharing of data: Prevented by verifying recipients, double-checking links and attachments, and carefully reviewing permissions before sharing.
   Failure to securely delete data: Avoided by following clear guidelines for secure disposal and regularly reviewing stored data.
   Using unsecured communication tools or personal devices for sensitive information: Prevented by strictly using approved company tools and devices for handling sensitive data.
