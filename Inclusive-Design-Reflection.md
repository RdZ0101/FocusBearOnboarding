üìù Reflection

1. How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?
    - Use clear, concise language
    - Provide visual aids when possible
    - Allow for breaks during long discussions
    - Offer written summaries of key points
    - Be patient and open to different communication preferences


2. What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?
    - Overwhelming interfaces with too many options
    - Lack of customization for sensory preferences
    - Inconsistent navigation or unexpected changes
    - Absence of clear, step-by-step instructions
    - Using abstract concepts without concrete examples


3. What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?
    - Implement a user feedback system specifically for neurodivergent users to continuously improve accessibility and inclusivity


üõ†Ô∏è Task

1. Read a first-person account from someone with ADHD or Autism about their experiences with productivity tools. (Hint: Look for blog posts, videos, or community discussions.)
    - After reading first-person accounts, a common theme is the need for flexibility and customization in productivity tools. Many users with ADHD or Autism express frustration with rigid systems that don't account for varying energy levels or sensory needs

2. Identify one design or communication improvement that could make Focus Bear more accessible.
    - Implement a customizable color scheme and font options to cater to individual sensory preferences and reduce visual overwhelm

3. Practice writing a clear, patient, and supportive response to a hypothetical user struggling with executive functioning.
